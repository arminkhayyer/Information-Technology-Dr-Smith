1- Remove the subtotals
2- The common columns in all fiscal years: 
	office
	quarter
	category
	date
	start date
	end date
	purpose
	amount
	year
	transcode
	recordID
   Keep these columns and remove the others
3- Remove 2009 from the data
4- Remove 2018 from the data
5- Clean the PAYEE column which includes some unnecessary characters
6- The Negative values should stay as it is. Cheking the real PDF files released by the House, I found that there are some negative
	values in the files so we should consider them as the returning values.
7-After data cleaning step(our first step in analyzing the data), we should answer some interesting question about the data.
	Some ideas can be seen in this website: https://web.archive.org/web/20150321015057/https://www.opencongress.org/wiki/House_Statement_of_Disbursements_and_Senate_Statement_of_Receipts_and_Expenditures#Possible_Types_of_Disbursement_Stories
	on the other hand after having the data cleaned we can discuss about the information that we are goıng to reveal using the data.
