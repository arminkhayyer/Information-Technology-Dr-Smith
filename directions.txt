1- Remove the subtotals
2- The common columns in all fiscal years: 
	office
	quarter
	category
	date
	start date
	end date
	purpose
	amount
	year
	transcode
	recordID
   Keep these columns and remove the others
3- Remove 2009 from the data
4- Remove 2018 from the data
5- Clean the PAYEE column which includes some unnecessary characters
6- The Negative values should stay as it is. Cheking the real PDF files released by the House, I found that there are some negative
	values in the files so we should consider them as the returning values.
